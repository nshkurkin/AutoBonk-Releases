# AutoBonk

AutoBonk is a desktop tool for visually interacting with your project automation. It‚Äôs primary function is to execute scripts and save logs. You can extend the available commands defined in a workspace as well as have your own user commands that call your scripts or act as your scripts.

While this tool is focused on Unreal Engine (I am a game developer), it can definitely be used in pretty much any other software development context.

This tool is closed-source. This github repo is meant to store examples, releases, and other supplemental code and materials. Please read the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) and [EULA](EULA.md) before using the application.
